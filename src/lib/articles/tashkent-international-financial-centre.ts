It is not an amendment to the tax code or a new incentive package — it is a constitutional-level instrument that carves out a defined territory within Uzbekistan and places it under a distinct legal order. This briefing sets out what the law actually establishes, how the regime works in practice, and how it measures against the established financial centres it is modelled on.",

TIFC is structurally different. The Constitutional Law establishes a territory with its own legal regime, its own regulator, its own court, and its own body of applicable law.

TIFC is established by Constitutional Law No. ZRU-1158 as a territory with its own legal regime, its own regulator (the Financial Services Authority), and its own court (the Tashkent International Commercial Court). Within the centre, TIFC decisions prevail over conflicting national legislation, and matters not covered by TIFC rules are governed subsidiarily by the common law and equity of England and Wales.",
      },
      {
        question: "What tax applies inside TIFC?",
        answer: "The national Tax Code applies inside the centre only where the Constitutional Law or a TIFC resolution expressly provides. TIFC bodies and their wholly-owned entities are exempt from corporate profit tax and social tax until 1 January 2076, and qualified participants are exempt on income from financial services over the same period, subject to economic-substance and governance conditions. The exception is large multinational groups — those with consolidated annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more — which receive no exemption and instead pay a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax at the standard national rate (15%), in line with the OECD Pillar Two global minimum tax.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does TIFC compare to AIFC in Kazakhstan?",
        answer: "The AIFC (Astana, established 2018) is the closest analogue and the evident template. Both are created by constitutional-level statute, base their law on English common-law principles, use English as the official language, operate an independent financial regulator and an independent English-language court, and grant a roughly fifty-year tax exemption (AIFC to 2066, TIFC to 2076). TIFC modernises the model by hard-wiring the OECD Pillar Two minimum tax into the founding law and by including an explicit digital-assets mandate from the outset — features the AIFC and older centres such as DIFC and ADGM addressed only later.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does English common law differ from Uzbek law in practice?",
        answer: "Uzbekistan is a civil-law jurisdiction: its private law is codified and judges apply written provisions, with prior judgments carrying only persuasive weight. England and Wales operate on common law, where much of the substantive law lives in decided cases and courts are bound by precedent. For commercial parties the practical consequences are greater predictability from an established body of case law, broad freedom of contract, the availability of trusts and equitable remedies (specific performance, injunctions) that have no direct Uzbek equivalent, and interpretation focused on the commercial purpose of the bargain. Inside TIFC, participants can contract and litigate on this basis without selecting a foreign governing law or forum.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can a foreign-licensed financial firm operate in TIFC?",
        answer: "Yes, through the transitional routes in Articles 32 and 33. A holder of a valid national Uzbek licence may continue to provide the licensed services within the centre without a fresh application, provided it registers a subsidiary or branch as a permitted transitional participant within sixty days of activation. An entity licensed in a recognised foreign jurisdiction may obtain a transitional licence where the TIFC Administration has concluded a memorandum of understanding or other supervisory-cooperation arrangement with that firm's home regulator. The catalogue of recognised jurisdictions and regulators is to be set by TIFC resolution.",
      },
      {
        question: "When will TIFC be operational?",
        answer: "The Constitutional Law is in force, but the centre is not yet operational. The TIFC bodies have twelve months from entry into force — extendable by the Council by up to six months — to adopt the foundational resolutions on governance, regulation, adjudication, and operations. Only then does the Council assess readiness and submit an activation decision to the President for approval. The detailed tax, currency, and residency rules will be published as implementing resolutions during that window. Officials expect the centre to start operating in 2027.",

        question: "TXMM erkin iqtisodiy zonami?",
        answer: "Yoʻq. Erkin iqtisodiy zona soliq va bojxona imtiyozlarini beradi, biroq kompaniyalarni oddiy oʻzbek fuqarolik, korporativ va tijorat huquqiga hamda oddiy sudlarga boʻysundirib qoldiradi. TXMM OʻRQ-1158-sonli Konstitutsiyaviy qonun bilan oʻz huquqiy rejimiga, oʻz regulyatoriga (Moliyaviy xizmatlar boshqarmasi) va oʻz sudiga (Toshkent xalqaro tijorat sudi) ega hudud sifatida tashkil etilgan. Markaz doirasida TXMM qarorlari zid milliy qonunchilikdan ustunlikka ega, TXMM qoidalari bilan qamrab olinmagan masalalar esa subsidiar tarzda Angliya va Uels umumiy huquqi va adolat huquqi bilan tartibga solinadi.",

        question: "TXMM ichida qanday soliqlar qoʻllaniladi?",
        answer: "Milliy Soliq kodeksi markaz ichida faqat Konstitutsiyaviy qonun yoki TXMM qarori bevosita nazarda tutgan hollardagina qoʻllaniladi. TXMM organlari va ularga toʻliq tegishli tashkilotlar 2076-yil 1-yanvarga qadar foyda soligʻi va ijtimoiy soliqdan ozod, malakali ishtirokchilar esa xuddi shu davrda moliyaviy xizmatlardan olingan daromad boʻyicha iqtisodiy mohiyat va boshqaruv shartlariga rioya etilgan holda ozod qilinadi. Istisno — yirik koʻp millatli guruhlar (konsolidatsiyalashgan yillik daromadi 750 mln yevro va undan ortiq): ular ozod etilmaydi va buning oʻrniga OECD Pillar Two global minimal soligʻiga muvofiq standart milliy stavkada (15%) malakali ichki minimal soliq toʻlaydi.",

        question: "TXMM Qozogʻistondagi AIFC bilan qanday taqqoslanadi?",
        answer: "AIFC (Astana, 2018-yilda tashkil etilgan) — eng yaqin analog va aniq namuna. Ikkalasi ham konstitutsiyaviy darajadagi akt bilan yaratilgan, huquqini ingliz umumiy huquqi tamoyillariga asoslaydi, inglizchani rasmiy til sifatida ishlatadi, mustaqil moliyaviy regulyator va mustaqil inglizzabon sudga ega hamda taxminan ellik yillik soliq ozod etishini beradi (AIFC — 2066-yilgacha, TXMM — 2076-yilgacha). TXMM modelni OECD Pillar Two minimal soligʻini taʼsis qonuniga bevosita kiritib va boshidanoq raqamli aktivlarga oid aniq mandatni kiritib modernizatsiya qiladi — bu AIFC va DIFC hamda ADGM kabi eski markazlar faqat keyinroq hisobga olgan xususiyatlardir.",

        question: "Ingliz umumiy huquqi oʻzbek huquqidan amalda nimasi bilan farq qiladi?",
        answer: "Oʻzbekiston — kontinental (fuqarolik) huquqi yurisdiksiyasi: uning xususiy huquqi kodlashtirilgan, sudyalar yozma qoidalarni qoʻllaydi, oldingi qarorlar esa faqat ishontiruvchi ahamiyatga ega. Angliya va Uels umumiy huquq boʻyicha ishlaydi, unda moddiy huquqning katta qismi hal qilingan ishlarda joylashgan, sudlar esa pretsedent bilan bogʻlangan. Tijorat tomonlari uchun amaliy oqibatlar — oʻrnashgan pretsedentlar majmuasi hisobiga kattaroq oldindan aytib boʻluvchanlik, keng shartnoma erkinligi, oʻzbek huquqida bevosita ekvivalenti boʻlmagan trastlar va adolat huquqi vositalarining (real ijro, sud taqiqlari) mavjudligi hamda bitimning tijorat maqsadiga qaratilgan talqin. TXMM ichida ishtirokchilar chet el qoʻllaniladigan huquqi yoki forumini tanlamasdan shu asosda shartnoma tuzishi va nizolashishi mumkin.",

        question: "Xorijiy litsenziyaga ega moliyaviy kompaniya TXMMda ishlashi mumkinmi?",
        answer: "Ha, 32 va 33-moddalardagi oʻtish yoʻllari orqali. Amaldagi milliy oʻzbek litsenziyasi egasi litsenziyalangan xizmatlarni markaz doirasida yangi arizasiz koʻrsatishni davom ettirishi mumkin, agar u faollashtirishdan oltmish kun ichida ruxsat etilgan oʻtish davri ishtirokchisi sifatida shoʻba kompaniya yoki filialni roʻyxatdan oʻtkazsa. Tan olingan xorijiy yurisdiksiyada litsenziyalangan shaxs, agar TXMM maʼmuriyati bu kompaniyaning uy regulyatori bilan oʻzaro anglashuv memorandumini yoki boshqa nazorat hamkorligi kelishuvini tuzgan boʻlsa, oʻtish davri litsenziyasini olishi mumkin. Tan olingan yurisdiksiyalar va regulyatorlar roʻyxati TXMM qarori bilan belgilanadi.",

      {
        question: "TXMM qachon ishga tushadi?",
        answer: "Konstitutsiyaviy qonun kuchga kirgan, biroq markaz hali ishlamaydi. TXMM organlarida qonun kuchga kirgan kundan oʻn ikki oy — Kengash tomonidan olti oygacha uzaytirilishi mumkin — boshqaruv, tartibga solish, sudlov va faoliyat boʻyicha asosiy qarorlarni qabul qilish uchun bor. Faqat shundan keyin Kengash tayyorlikni baholaydi va faollashtirish qarorini Prezidentga tasdiqlash uchun taqdim etadi. Soliq, valyuta va rezidentlik boʻyicha batafsil qoidalar shu davr mobaynida ijro qarorlari sifatida eʼlon qilinadi. Rasmiylar markaz 2027-yilda ishga tushishini kutmoqda.",
