This streamlined timeline was introduced by Presidential Decree No. UP-5739 of 7 June 2019, which replaced the previous more cumbersome process.

        question: "Is newspaper publication required for voluntary liquidation in Uzbekistan?",
        answer: "No. The 2019 reform abolished the newspaper publication requirement. Liquidation notices are now posted exclusively on the State Services Centre's official website. The minimum period for creditors to file claims is 2 months from the website posting. If a company has never conducted any business activity since registration and has no tax debts, no financial audit is required either.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is the priority order for settling creditor claims during liquidation in Uzbekistan?",
        answer: "Claims are settled in the following order: first, employee claims under employment contracts and claims of individuals for personal injury or death caused by the company; second, payments to the state budget and state-targeted funds; third, all remaining claims. Claims secured by a pledge are satisfied first from proceeds of selling the pledged asset; any shortfall is then covered in the priority order above.",
      },
      {
        question: "What are the key steps to complete voluntary liquidation in Uzbekistan?",
        answer: "The 13-step procedure includes: (1) adopt liquidation resolution; (2) appoint liquidator from founders or participants; (3) notify the State Services Centre within 1 working day — it automatically notifies tax authorities, statistics, banks, and others; (4) notify banks; (5) tax authority and Enforcement Bureau audit covering up to 3 years; (6) settle creditor claims after the 2-month notice period; (7) approve the interim liquidation balance sheet; (8) approve the final liquidation balance sheet; (9) obtain tax clearance certificate; (10) close the main bank account; (11) transfer documents to the state archive; (12) make final submission to the State Services Centre with bank certificates and archive confirmation.",

        question: "O'zbekistonda ixtiyoriy tugatish qancha vaqt oladi?",
        answer: "Maksimal muddat — Davlat xizmatlari markazi tugatish to'g'risidagi xabarnomani olgan kundan boshlab 6 oy. Bu soddalashtirilgan muddat 2019 yil 7 iyundagi PF-5739-sonli Prezident Farmoni bilan kiritilgan va oldingi murakkabroq tartibni almashtirdi. Soddalashtirilgan tartib gazetada e'lon chop etish talabini ham bekor qildi — tugatish to'g'risidagi e'lonlar endi faqat Davlat xizmatlari markazining rasmiy veb-saytida joylashtiriladi.",

        question: "O'zbekistonda ixtiyoriy tugatish uchun gazetada e'lon chop etish talab etiladimi?",
        answer: "Yo'q. 2019 yilgi islohot gazetada e'lon chop etish talabini bekor qildi. Tugatish to'g'risidagi e'lonlar endi faqat Davlat xizmatlari markazining rasmiy veb-saytida joylashtiriladi. Kreditorlar talablarini taqdim etishning minimal muddati veb-saytda joylashtirilgan kundan boshlab 2 oyni tashkil etadi. Kompaniya ro'yxatdan o'tgandan beri hech qanday xo'jalik faoliyati yuritmagan bo'lsa va soliq qarzlari bo'lmasa, moliyaviy audit ham talab qilinmaydi.",

        question: "O'zbekistonda tugatish jarayonida kreditorlar talablarini qondirish navbati qanday?",
        answer: "Talablar quyidagi navbatda qondiriladi: birinchi navbat — mehnat shartnomalari bo'yicha xodimlar talablari va kompaniya tomonidan jismoniy shaxslarning hayotiga yoki sog'lig'iga yetkazilgan zararni qoplash bo'yicha talablar; ikkinchi navbat — davlat byudjetiga va davlat maqsadli jamg'armalariga to'lovlar; uchinchi navbat — barcha qolgan talablar. Garov bilan ta'minlangan talablar birinchi navbatda garovga qo'yilgan aktivni sotishdan tushgan mablag' hisobidan qondiriladi; yetishmayotgan summa yuqoridagi navbatda qoplanadi.",
